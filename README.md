- **💻 Modern Web Interface**: Professional medical-grade UI with animated visualizations
- **📊 Real-time Risk Assessment**: Instant CVD risk calculation with probability scores
- **🎨 Interactive Visualization**: Animated heart that changes color based on risk level
- **📈 Feature Importance**: Visual breakdown of key risk factors

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Data Processing**: Custom preprocessing pipeline
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier (200 estimators)

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Cross-Validation Accuracy**: 93.0% (±3.8%)
- **Precision**: 99% for CVD risk prediction
- **Recall**: 100% for CVD case detection
- **Training Data**: 1,000 synthetic patient records
- **Features**: 21 total (15 health + 6 environmental)

## 📚 Research Background

This project addresses key limitations identified in cardiovascular risk assessment:

- Traditional methods (Framingham, QRISK) ignore diverse populations and modern lifestyles
- Environmental factors significantly impact CVD risk but are often overlooked
- Machine learning can capture complex, non-linear relationships in health data
- London's air quality issues make environmental integration particularly relevant
